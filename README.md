# Project-ID Number: 2334



This project is part of the spring semester course "Skills: Programming - Introduction Level 2021" under the direction of Dr. Mario Silic.
 
This project was carried out individually by Vedran Lakic. The code was written in the programming language Python and implemented with jupyter notebook using Python3.

Please read the PDF-File first. There you will find the specific program description (Chapter 1) and information on how to implement the code (Chapter 2) to use the program for yourself. A illustrative example using Tesla stock is also shown in Chapter 3. The second distributed file contains the code in jupyter notebook format.


Have fun using the program :-)
