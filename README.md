# H$G-Elite-Trading-Program

# Stock-Analysis-Forecast Python Project




This project is part of the spring semester course "Skills: Programming - Introduction Level 2021" under the direction of Dr. Mario Silic.
 
This project was carried out individually by Vedran Lakic. The code was written in a jupyter notebook environment using Python3. Please read the PDF-File first. There you will find the specific program description (Chapter 1) and information on how to implement the code (Chapter 2) to use the program for yourself. A illustrative example using Tesla stock is also shown in Chapter 3. The second distributed file contains the code in an .ipynb file.


Have fun using the program :-)
